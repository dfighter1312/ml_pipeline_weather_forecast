# Machine Learning Pipeline - Weather Forecast

Task for this week:
- Build an algorithm to forecast weather data.
- Data source: Max-Planck-Institut fuer Biogeochemie - Wetterdaten
- Use at least one model in: MLP, LSTM, Linear Regression.
- Things should be cover: Extract data, transform to a suitable format, use a simple algorithm to predict.
